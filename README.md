# Virtual Assistance Roxy
This app made by me. I create it by Python language.

Use file "Main_Roxie.py" to start Roxy.
If you start another file python the program cannot run.
You can use your voice to interact with Roxy. 
Roxy will rely your information base on the thing you talk.

Note: When you use this app make use you have some 
library in there first if not install them like this:

	+ pip install playsound==1.2.2
	+ pip install pyttsx3==2.71
	+ pip install wikipedia
	+ pip install speechrecognition
	+ pip install pipwin
	+ pip install pyaudio
	+ pip install pywin32
	+ pip install datetime
	+ pip install webbrowser

All function I analyze in the report. You can read how that function work in app.
If you like contact me to develop this app better and better.

I create 1 EXE file in 'dist folder' so you can open and use it if you don't 
want to open Software Programming.
